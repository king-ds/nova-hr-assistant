527113148026901,527405417997674,"**End of Week Report - August 9, 2019**

**Project Name: Novare Internal**

Discussed the Data Science team KPIs and had a one on one meeting with each member. The goal is to fix all of their individual development plans and interact with them amidst a very busy day and to set SMART goals

Already discussed with the team what are the next steps and also asked them to start working on the discussed internal data science projects

**Project Name: Chinabank Analytics**

We have a new engagement on Chinabank, almost the same as the previous engagement though this time we are more detailed on the project scope. We still lack 1 sign to proceed with the project, however the 2 other signees, as mentioned to me, will persuade the other signee therefore let’s prepare for this engagement as well. Right now, I am seeing Jeff and Adrian to do the chinabank project

**Project Name: SMART ETL POC**

I was on-boarded on the SMART Talend POC, with the goal of leading the team and making sure that every client expectations were met during this POC. We are very pressed on time,  therefore there is a need for us to work on holidays, but that will depend on the daily team achievements

There is a really high chance that we might get this project with SMART, since even if the business is leaning more towards another party and sometimes impeding our progress by not providing any needed documents, as of the moment we do not have any blockers to finish the POC. Also I have informed Julie and Elton already that on the project proper, we can’t afford not to have the OEM parser for nokia CDRs

I am also helping on other scripts since some of the scripts are written in scala. There are some instances that we need to call OS level scripts from talend. 

Presentation for use case A and F will be on August 15, 2019. Shashank will need our help since some of the components for these use cases are tied up with use case B which the team is currently doing. Everything is on schedule so far

Checked some discrepancies on the SMS CDR. This is due to some errors made on the mapping by Mark Tan before he left. It was quickly fixed as to not affect on any ingestion workflow

The target is to finish the whole dev work on use case B this week (August 9, 2019) to make room for bulk tests and optimizations. I will push Mark to finish CM CDR today. We actually need more time however Alex needs something to be presented by August 15 (2 use cases out of 3) because as mentioned by vivian, Alex is pro Talend and would like to award this already and start with project proper preparations and discussions. 

Will work on some reports needed for other use cases (like the geo spatial report). Any requirement which is do not have any Talend native component are written on scripts then will be called by Talend on OS level

**Project Name: Aboitiz Power Data Lake**

There was a discussion with the contract and other changes. AEV procurement called me and was so irritated because to them, MDI-Novare does not have strong collaboration and relationship with Talend. They gave us 1 month to answer and review everything and yet they mentioned that no reply was sent to them. However, everything was quickly fixed and arranged this week as to not impede the project proper any further. There will be SRS and Architecture review on August 20, 2019 (date subject to change)

GE and OSI PI APIs were discussed this week. These are the remaining data sources which were not yet discussed to us, thus completing the Client KT to Vendor phase of the data discovery. Mark already sent the unfinished mapping documents to Jas. 

**Project Name: Globe EDA**

Discussed with Reinald the key concepts of machine learning and how to make some business out of it. Explained to him the activities a normal EDA usually have and helped him with his clarifications, question sending, and EE creation. Globe will answer all the questions sent, and actually also asking us to recommend something which we think they need.",2019-08-13T02:37:07+0000,{}

*(reposting from the `#batch19_instructors` group)*

Hey Jude, Joshua,

I noticed your names are on teaching git today. If you need assistance in setting this up for their BitBucket, just give us a mention on Armory if needed.

If I have to share some basic guidelines and reminders:

- [Newbie Guide][1] is available here. I'll share this to their Slack channel in a while, since this has instructions to set up BitBucket.

- For the actual git lecture
  - If you need them to work on a group git repository, I'll have these prepared. Just do the usual ⚒ mention in `#general` and we'll be able to assist.
  - Let's try to limit repository transfers. They can work on their individual BitBucket accounts if they need to push their work somewhere. Request for transfers if they need to work as a team (hence the statement above)

- Some helpful resources
  - BitBucket has its own [guides for repository setup][2]
  - Git installation is covered either [here][3] or [here][4]

Thanks!

King and Benjamin,

Study network science. Familiarize yourselves with different network algorithms like Louvain, Leiden, Bipartitions etc. Do a research about it. Also just keep on strengthening your python skills

Justin, 

Learn PySpark and its benefits. You know Python and R right? your task is to learn Scala and SparkML. Believe me you will need it. 

Kylie, 

Strengthen your python skills. familiarize yourself with micro service approach and utilize other parts of django, specifically djangoREST. as I see it, your strength is on application level and APIs

Renzo and Louies,

Focus on what you are currently doing now with RPI. After you are done with that, Familiarize yourselves in RPA. Emerging tech is your thing.

I thought it is over but it's not. Today, Shashank sent an email to me saying that SMART business team want our social network analysis (use case A) to be PER MIN LEVEL (per mobile number). The lib that I made in Java only calculates the metrics per graph total, not per min and they know it. They might be thinking that it will cripple our progress towards our final presentation on August 30 because of this sudden change. Also Shashank asked them to provide some formula but they told us that ""No, you discover it yourselves"". Why am I telling you this? because this is the reality of our local industry. This is what I always tell you team. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR YOU TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THE ALGORITHM AND THE THEORY BEHIND. SMART is currently getting all their needed metrics using Teradata for 3 months worth of transaction logs (approx: 2 Billion, 40 million transaction rows) within 8 hours, utilizing the power of their full cluster. They need to stop other processes to do this highly compute intensive task. You know why? because they do not know Louvain. I imitated Teradata's capabilities using python and I could finish 100000 rows in 40 seconds getting all of the needed measurements PER MIN LEVEL utilizing only 4GB of RAM for computation in my laptop. I am estimating that I could process the whole quarter year worth of data in less than 2 hours on a single node, using only 128GB of RAM. Imagine how fast it will be when I run it on the cluster. I'll teach this tool dependent weaklings how to properly do data science. Attached is my code for reference. Transformed my notebook into an HTML file so that anyone could read, just open in your web browsers.

Business Insider Intelligence

This is a preview of a five-part slide deck from Business Insider Intelligence. To learn more about Business Insider Intelligence, click here.

The pace of change in financial services has never been faster. In only the first quarter of 2019, Apple Card sent a shock wave through the credit card space, FIS' $35 billion Wirecard acquisition set a record in the payments industry, and Fifth Third's acquisition of MB Financial minted a new top-five bank.

Looking ahead, the mix of investor capital, sweeping global regulations, technological developments, and financial services globalization will promise to ignite more major developments before the year ends.

The incumbent banking and payment providers presiding over this landscape will face a mounting challenge to keep up. Firms must stay ahead of technology demands, preserve their bottom lines, grow their customer bases, and stay on the right side of regulators.

Meanwhile, fintech threats keep growing in scale and breadth, buoyed by disruptive business models, agility, an advantageous regulatory position, and low overhead. These companies are reaching ever further across the financial services value chain, from banking to insurance, wealth management, and payments.

In THE FUTURE OF FINTECH 2019, Business Insider Intelligence's fintech research team analyzes the five most important megatrends reshaping financial services with detailed data, analysis, and and actionable insights for financial services providers.

Here are some key takeaways from the 130+ slide deck:

### This exercise involves building a non-trivial dictionary.
### The subject is books.

### The key for each book is its title
### The value associated with that key is a dictionary

### ### In that dictionary there will be Three keys: They are all strings, they are:
### ### ""Pages"", ""Author"", ""Publisher""

### ### ### ""Pages"" is associated with one value - an int

### ### ### ""Author is associated with a dictionary as value
### ### ### ### That ""Author"" dictionary has two keys: ""First"", and ""Last"" each with a string value

### ### ### ""Publisher"" is associated with a dictionary as value
### ### ### ### That ""Publisher"" dict has one key ""Location"" with a string as value.

### An Example might look like:
### {""Harry Potter"": {""Pages"":200, ""Author"":{""First"":""J.K"", ""Last"":""Rowling""}, ""Publisher"":{""Location"":""NYC""}},
###  ""Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas"": { ...}}

### Code a function called ""build_book_dict""
### ACCEPT five inputs, all lists of n-length
### ### A list of titles, pages, first<name>, last<name>, and <publisher>location.

### RETURN a dictionary as described above.
### Keys must be spelled just as they appear above - correctly and capitalized.

### YOUR ANSWER BELOW

Let us set a set day and time; best if we can also sit in one area; if needed, can be an online meeting - let me know what day and time works best for each.

## Shareable Feedback Forms

As advised before, if you haven't done yet, please read and consider sharing the links described in [**this post**][1] so I can collect feedback from your peers and clients.

The data is intended to be viewable by me only, so I can anonymize their names when it's presented during eval time.

Sharing the results of the feedback forms (as of 2019-08-30):

- Jeffrey Estaris - 2 responses
- Lorenzo Ortiz - 3 responses

## Sessions

This one's late, but I still wish to meet up with each of you next week. Non-stop meetings at our clients have made it difficult, sorry!

Agenda for the most part would be:

- How's your current work, and how well are you doing at it.
- The performance appraisal self-assessment, as of this year so far.
- Looking for ways to improve the above.
- How well are we on track in terms of objectives
- Random, offbeat stuff.

As for the team:

- Keifer Fababeir, Joseph Ongsingco, since we're all in the same project team, I'll try to arrange time for these during the week whenever I'm at GTP.

- If you're deployed elsewhere: please tell me the best dates for this week to meet up. I'll send an invitation by then. Expect after-office invites, unless it's Friday.

- Everyone else: I'll send session invites for either Friday or if any of the dates above would make sense to do multiple sessions.

## Sidenote

Are people comfortable with 1-on-1 meetings via Hangouts? I prefer meeting face-to-face, but because of the difficulties of deployments, weather, traffic and arranging meeting rooms, it might be better to do things this way instead.

I've updated the links to *feedback forms* that you can send to your peers or your clients -- usually at the end of the project or the year although you *could* use it anytime. Just keep these bookmarked.

It's basically a convenient way to collect feedback about your work performance since it'll end up in a Google Sheet that I maintain. It's what's used as objective metrics before the *Performance Appraisal season* that we usually do at the start of the year.

## What's Next

I'll be updating everyone's forms again *to reflect the results of the deliberation activity*. 

Some scores will go *up or down* as a result, as it's relative to how we've assessed everyone on the same career level as you are.

**I'll share these results once they're done.**
[Note the updates on my checklist from before.][1]

## For Transparency

**We've already determined who's recommended for salary raises and promotions.**

What happens next? Dale, our SEG Head basically has to convince Topher about the results.

And then Topher has to convince the higher-ups (HR, Mancom, etc) that all our recommendations are justified. 

*This'll happen for the entire month of February.*

The results should come sometime around March, maybe April at the latest.

Automating policies in cloud environments are a common concern for companies, and including our own environment since it's easy to lose track of resources and compliance.

AWS has rules engines like AWS Config, but that costs money as your infrastructure gets bigger.

**Cloud Custodian** looks like it's capable of doing the same thing, if not more and with actual actions (i.e., stop noncompliant resources after X days) when rules are broken.

Just a reminder when a project is asking for a new repository, there are guidelines that you have to follow.

- [**New Repository + User Groups**][1]
- [**New User Creation**][2]

Note the **User Groups** section:

- make sure that new user groups aren’t granted read/write permissions by default for new projects!
- make sure that new hires that are for CL1 aren’t included in Novare Developers until they’ve finished their Bootcamp (so they can’t peek to previous batches’ work)

Recent changes are highlighted in commits and their diffs at [`a62460`][3] and [`a5bf0f`][4]

Keifer Fababeir, Joseph Ongsingco, Kent Flores and I just attended AWS' seminar on this, so I'm sharing the three Labs demos that they encouraged users to follow so they'll learn.

We can apply this to get used to EKS and ECS. I have some ideas on my mind already on what we'll do with Armory.

- [**Break a Monolith Application into Microservices**][1] - The easy course to using ECS.
- [**CatsNDogs Workshop**][2] - A more advanced course to learning ECS. It's a self-paced course that tackles production concerns.
- [**EKS Workshop**][3] - The longest, but still self-paced course featuring Kubernetes. Contains interesting topics that you'd want for a fully-functional K8S setup.

## Why bother ECS?

I can see a real incentive to use ECS and changing between Fargate and EC2 styles, versus Kubernetes. It's all worth noting imo.

## Discussion Points

- SEG Infrastructure - We now have our own AWS space (SEG Infra) and have sufficient budget to try things out for ourselves.
- Goals
  - We need to migrate the remaining servers to SEG Infra.
  - We need to utilize SEG Infra as a space to learn systems and operations, to explore DevOps and to improve our overall development cycle and build better software through tools.

## Existing Services

During the discussion, the group has decided to:

- Redmine - Transfer the entire instance’s contents to Lightsail. No upgrades needed, just make sure that it’s running on a properly-sized server that isn’t overpriced.
- Artifactory - Same as above.
- Jenkins - We’ll decommission Jenkins in favor of a new instance/s that can fulfill our needs for DevOps (e.g., Android, Web support via container build environments, and Jenkins X)

## New Services

Now that we have our own space, we can begin exploring new ways to introduce new development tools to improve the overall quality-of-life of our fellow developers and their work.

- Kubernetes - We’ll use EKS and provision a Sandbox cluster to explore.
- Mattermost - Currently explored and we’ll probably consider deploying.

## Workflow

Everyone’s encouraged to take tasks proactively. All of it is available on our [Wekan board.](http://wekan.dev.novare.com.hk/b/pjrRe4kK2PmgaQ9Me/armory/TGk5BCtZak6xjCw2u)

Just make sure to assign and move them so everyone’s informed in Slack.

* Distribution of tasks, checking up on members deployed offsite.
* Setting up our own cluster for development use. (We'll probably go EKS on this one)

Last meeting, our very own Emmanuel Joi Albania was one of the speakers. He talked about using Lottie for UI Animation.

Here are is a feedback from Mynt:

""Emman, showed the Animating GCAT on the screen added using Lottie. Overall the reception was good. We were able to introduce Mynt, Ant and GCash subtlety. 

People were generally interested as to what GCash were doing with animations, growing the e-wallet industry and as to why Alibaba partnered with Mynt. I was able to talk to high school student wanting to go on a tour at the Mynt office to have a feel of what we are doing. Spoke to a college professor asking me to speak to students, regarding why they should study Computer Science. Discussed with a CTO on how he could integrate his apps to a payment system like GCash. More importantly, I was able to pitch GCash and Mynt to a number of potential new hires.""

2236632456389213,2535691616483294,"# ℹ️ Sharing: Including Documents in Version Control

I've been trying out lately how we can improve software projects by checking in documentation along with our source code, and so far [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is pretty nice for its simplicity.

*Here's a video demo of Armory's documentation with just a few minutes of mkdocs. The existing docs that I wrote only took little to no editing and it worked. I just had to reorganize things.*

How it works:
- Just write Markdown files in a `docs` folder.
- Provide a simple `mkdocs.yml` file
- Install `mkdocs` (super-easy: just `pip install mkdocs`) then use it to `mkdocs serve`
- You have a fully-functional static site for documentation.

I want to push this into a *standard* somehow, since having your docs as part of your code has a lot of benefits:

- It's readable anywhere; just open it on your favorite Markdown editor.
- It's *resilient*. Other docs either rely on the cloud (Google Docs) or is difficult to update or find because of discoverability issues. Putting your work in the same repo makes that a no-brainer.
- It gets git powers as well -- docs are version-controlled according to their current version, can be `diff`ed, and no need to keep a ""version history"" session since git's commit system makes that mandatory.
- It's highly portable. You can convert this to any format, from PDFs, to DOCX, to HTML.
- It's easily hostable. This is as easy as taking an Angular site to production -- just place it in an S3 bucket and it's immediately viewable.",2019-07-16T02:35:36+0000,"{'100032640691147': 'LIKE', '100032910843972': 'LIKE', '100033002732061': 'LIKE', '100032886459278': 'LIKE', '100032779366610': 'LIKE', '100032961155069': 'LIKE'}"

Just an FYI, we've had various documents that are handy to keep in mind in day-to-day work.

- I'm maintaining a [**For New Employees**][3] guide in Armory. This has been updated quite a bit since the last time.

-  John Gregory Jose has shared and listed the essential [**SEG Documents**][2] in this Google Drive. 

- Aiza Bermudez is also maintaining a [**Roll-in Checklist here**][1]. (Very good stuff, I'll try to consolidate those items with what I've made.)

Greg, Aiza, thanks for the good work on the above!

If anyone has more documents or templates to share, please feel free to contribute! Building our knowledge base is key to enjoying a seamless process in the future.

Three sisters from a poor family petitioned the abbot of the Laughing Monkey Clan for admission to the Temple as developers.

“I cannot hire any of you,” said the abbot after he looked at their résumés and code samples. “You do not have the necessary experience.”

“But it is the same complaint everywhere we go!” protested one of the sisters. “How are we to acquire experience if we are refused entrance to every place that offers experience simply because we lack experience?”

Master Kaimu happened to be passing by and overheard this. He said to the girls: “Desire is the root of all suffering. If you cannot do what you desire, then do what you must, so that in your spare time you may do what you truly love.”

The master then departed, but the girls were not comforted.

- - -
Several months later the master came upon these same three sisters sharing a humble meal in the village. He asked them how they fared.

The first said, “By day I do carpentry to pay the bills, and by night I carve sculptures for my amusement.”

The second said, “By day I sell fish to pay the bills, and by night I practice dance for my amusement.”

The third said, “By day I repair garments to pay the bills, and by night I code little applications for my amusement.”

Kaimu returned to the abbot and, telling him what had transpired, said, “Admit the third sister to your clan, for she has what we seek.”

The abbot asked, “Should we not advise her elder sisters to follow her example, that they might gain experience and also be admitted?”

“Null,” said Kaimu. “How can we advise them on ‘what to truly love?‘”",2019-07-05T02:15:07+0000,{'100032778736534': 'LIKE'}

Hello everyone! We'd like to remind everyone that we're partnered with Amazon, and with it comes along the facilities for the Amazon Partner Network (APN).

# **[Please take the time to register here][2], and read on.**

## What's this all about?

Using your MDI/Novare addresses, you can register in the APN and take some of the courses that are available there. Part of the benefits include access to some of the virtual (online/on-demand) courses available at no-cost, and it's a good place to begin between the actual certification exams.

If you're ever idle at work, studying AWS is a good use of time. Completing courses and certifications will lead you to being better equipped at work and earning good results for your performance appraisal.

- [Read more about the APN here][1].

- [**Check the AWS Partner Learning Path Tool**][3] so you can see what courses you'll want to take.

**The link to always remember is [aws.training](https://www.aws.training).**

## Any Recommendations?

Personally, I would recommend this route:

- Take the [**AWS Technical Professional**][6] course. It's online and I recommend taking it if you have the free time to do so.

- Take the time to actually use AWS! The [Free Tier][7] is readily available and I recommend registering for your own account to learn how it works. (Tip: You can pay for AWS using GCash or PayMaya, and you can keep costs low by utilizing it only when needed and setting an AWS Budget)

- Aim for[ **Associate-level certification!**][8] It's a main part of the [Developer][4] and [Architect][5] learning paths. Talk to your admin TMs to learn more on this, since training courses can be routed through our APN membership.

Kindly place your name on the ""volunteer names"" column. If there is already a name, then write yours on another column to its right. There is no limit on the number of topics you wish to teach as long as you can commit. Not all topics are dev-exclusive, so QAs can teach some topics too (we highly encourage you to do so).

This is inline with our Growth Involvements KPI to grow our organization by imparting our knowledge to our associate software engineers. Deadline of volunteering will be on Wednesday July 3th. Afterwards, our facilitators will get in touch with you soon to secure your schedule.

Hello everyone,

Just making sure that everyone has access, **regular employees and new hires above CL1 should have basic read access** to our `novaretechnologies` BitBucket team.

A quick way to check if your account: **[try accessing the JenkinsBasics repository][1]**. You should see the contents of the repo. If not, then we need to fix your project access.

NOTE: If you don't have a BitBucket account yet,  we're following a username format: **`firstname_lastname_novare`**.

Just a quick FYI for everyone that I've updated our docs at the [**SEG Armory** portal][1].

**References to Wekan and Workplace are now mentioned in our process documentation at Armory.**

- The onboarding [**checklist for new hires**][2] has been clarified -- services are listed and how to register and how to join in on projects are now defined. If you have a new teammate who's also new to the org, you'll want to share them that link.

- For the leads, the [**Starting a Project**][3] page has been updated to reflect our new Wekan service and some additional pointers you'll want to add to your project.

As always, if anyone needs help on getting started, you can share these links to help your fellow teammates if they aren't yet aware of how to request for access or pointers on what to do.

Thanks!

P.S. If anyone here likes the idea of contributing to our process documentation, tell me about it. :D

SM Data Integration RFP

Globe Anaplan Opportunity
- Had a meeting with Globe last week to discuss their requirements. Globe is looking for vendor who will create their reports on Anaplan. Some of the reports are forecasting, Budgeting, 5 year planning, etc which are all financial reports.
- Our concern is we don't have anaplan skillset for now but already informed Ned to check on the tool.
- Asked Globe for the sample dataset and the needed computations and data sources for each report but they don't have information yet so they consolidate and share to us but I think they won't be able to share it as soon as possible and the submission of proposal deadline is on Thursday.
- Asked if they can move the schedule but they said no. Will probably propose data analytics factory for this.

**BDO FinTech**

- Will attend a meeting with Mynt next week to start with scoping. Temporarily attending this since our assigned BA is still engaged with Mynt also so there might conflict - Will check with Melvin/Ryan in terms of the assigned resource

**BDO TNG**

- BDO decided to put this on hold first because of contract issues with TNG

**BDO Operationalization**

- Had meeting with Chicco last week to discuss the CICD Workshop for ITD team

- Shared presentation deck and we need to updates a few slides to add screenshots for apigee development steps

- Checked with Apigee (Rak) on the setup of organizations, environment, roles in apigee since BDO wanted to setup a per business group acceess to apigee but in Apigee you need to create one organization for each group in which it each organization will have one developer portal since one developer portal can only connect to one organization. Set an email with Rak to discuss this.

- Will have another meeting with Chicco this week to check the updated deck. Target CICD workshop is on 24 and 25.

**Trust Web Development**

- Had an onboarding meeting with Frost and will schedule another meeting to meet our Scrum Master next week and discuss the RACI.

**Globe ESB Re-Architecture**

- Had a presentation with Globe but still they wont share the RFP requirements with us. Presented Talend ESB and WSO2 ESB but they're more interested in WSO2 since it's 100% open source

- They're looking at a solution that in case they wanted to stop the subscription, they can still use it which WSO2 can do.

- Waiting for their feedback for another meeting to deep dive on WSO2

**BDO Websites MA with BDO**

- Discussed the requirements with Dale and decided not to push through with the opportunity we will need to maintain codes that we did not develop which is risky. Already informed Pao. 

**PNB Data Warehouse**

- Started with the proposal already and received updated compliance sheet from Talend

- Gab is working on the compliance sheet for Cloudera and Microsoft PowerBI for visualization part.

- Will have a meeting again with Gab next week to work on the timeline.

- Will check Radney if we have skillset for PowerBI as we're looking at subcontracting this component to other Microsoft's partners.

- Tried using PowerBI and I think can the team can easily adjust to using it even if we're more familiar with Tableau. Though I only tried the online version.

Warning! PLEASE READ. Especially golfers. 

1.) A doctor friend came to me to chat and said that the weather was very hot. Under the sun, it could reach 40 degrees C. He said...
> At 40 degrees, if you drink ice water in an instant, the micro blood vessels could explode. One of his friends just went into the house to wash his feet with cold water. Then his eyes could not see clearly, and he passed out. Only the ears could hear the sound. He was terrified!

2.) The temperature in some places has reached 38 degrees C or higher, but the temperature of the body sense should be higher. The danger is not just with drinking ice cold water. The same danger may occur with even washing hands / washing your face / washing your feet. You must not subject any part of the hot  body to temperature shock with cold water.  You need about 30 minutes to allow the body to cool down and adjusted to the indoor temperature. Drink natural temperature water / luke- warm water of  around 34 to 36 degrees C.

3.) There is a very strong man. The doctor had examined him in the hospital about three years ago. He met the man again and was surprised to find that he had a stroke. He was in a bad condition. The man told the doctor...
> Recently,  on a hot day, upon returning home,  in order to quickly cool off from the heat, I immediately took a cold shower. I felt that I could not move my jaws properly. I  immediately called an ambulance to send me to the hospital. That saved my life.

Remember, especially on a hot day, avoid fridge water or ice-cold water to cool off as it  will cause rapid contraction of blood vessels. 

Adults with young children at home should inform their helpers about this.

### The weather is abnormal recently.  It may be nice to have a cold drink to cool down,  but it is very dangerous! Avoid gulping down the drink, drink it  slowly.

Please pass this safety message to your family and friends.

Some guidelines for the pics:

- No app stickers or heavy filters.

- No costumes, wigs or outrageous/scandalous apparel.

296344504553547,336963103825020,"Multi-cloud management has always been the holy grail of infrastructure management. You see many tools and vendors promise it. But to date, none do it well. You heard me right... NONE. 

Imagine being able to move a VM from on premise Openstack to AWS. All vendors promise they have products that can do it. But the moment you ask how are the IPs addresses, DNS entities and network/security policies moved? They start enumerating exceptions and roadmaps.

However, a full containerized approach has the potential to solve this problem. A policy and configuration that is declarative. Of course, only if the application is written properly to use containers. This is why this space should be keenly studied including tools like Istio.

However,  we don't seem to be able to get good traction outside this area. Why? My guess is that unlike telcos most organizations do not have highly utilized analytics needs. They are most adhoc and it is only the storage that is committed. As we all know the economics of Hadoop on prem only make sense if utilization is high.
